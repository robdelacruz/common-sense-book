# Everyone has an Agenda

I have an agenda in writing this.

Everyone has an agenda.

Everything you watch has an agenda. Mainstream news has an agenda. TV shows and movies have an agenda. Social networking sites have an agenda. Internet websites have an agenda. People you talk to have an agenda. Churches, schools, employers - they all have an agenda.

Agendas serve to program your mind. They condition you to accept certain things as normal and approved behavior. They manipulate you into doing things it wants you to.

Agendas are backed by powerful people who want you to do things that are beneficial for them, at your expense. They come wrapped in nice, friendly packages, with the message: "everyone is doing this, so it must be good." Or they come in scary packages: "Do this or you will die." These agendas have been finely tuned over the decades to be as influential as possible.

Agendas are also called: brainwashing and mind-control.

Almost everything broadcast in this world for mass consumption has an agenda. You can choose to limit your exposure to it. Or continue consuming it, while being aware that what you're feeding your mind has an agenda. If you're vigilant, there's a chance you can guard against it.

What are examples of things that have little or no agenda? I've thought about this question. I think competitive sports is one. It's mostly just two teams battle it out over a ball and goalposts. Or two athletes battling each other in a ring or net court. I think broadcasts of competitive sports have little or no agenda. The pre and post shows, and interviews may have an agendathough.

What else has minimal agenda? Old public domain books in which the intellectual property rights have expired are good. They may have had an agenda at the time it was written, but at least it no longer has a current agenda. And the message of these books usually contains useful and robust information owing to the fact that it has survived this long.

Other things that have no agenda: Mathematics and natural science, physical training, building and fixing things, observation of things. These all keep the mind and body sharp. And they don't come with the baggage of an agenda. These are beneficial things than can replace much of what you're currently consuming.

In short, guard your mind against agendas. And try to focus more on the things that have little or no agenda.
