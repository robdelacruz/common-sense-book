# Everyone has an Agenda

I have an agenda in writing this.

Everyone has an agenda.

Everything you watch has an agenda. News programs have an agenda. TV shows and movies have an agenda. Social networking sites have an agenda. Internet websites have an agenda. The people you talk to have an agenda. Churches, schools, employers - they all have an agenda.

Agendas serve to program your mind. They condition you to accept certain things as normal and approved behavior. They manipulate you into doing things it wants you to.

Some agendas are backed by powerful people and organizations who want you to do things that are beneficial for them, at your expense. They come wrapped in nice, friendly packages, with the message: "everyone is doing this, so it must be good." Or they come in scary packages: "Do this or you will die." These agendas have been finely tuned over the decades to be as influential as possible.

In order to get you to comply with their agendas, powerful people and organizations use: brainwashing and mind-control.

Almost everything broadcast in this world for mass consumption has an agenda. You can choose to limit your exposure to it. Or continue consuming it, while being aware that what you're feeding your mind has an agenda. As long as you're aware that there's an agenda, you can guard against it.

On TV, the most agenda-less thing to watch has to be professional sports. It's hard for a basketball game or tennis match to have an agenda.

What else has minimal agenda? Old public domain books in which the intellectual property rights have expired are good. They may have had an agenda at the time it was written, but at least it no longer has a current agenda. And the message of these books usually contains useful and robust information owing to the fact that it has survived this long.

Other things that have no agenda: Mathematics and natural science, physical training, building and fixing things, observing things in the real world. These all keep the mind and body sharp. And they don't come with the baggage of an agenda. These are beneficial things than can replace much of what you're currently consuming.

Being aware of agendas in the things we consume is the first step to safeguarding against them.
